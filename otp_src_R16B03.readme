--- HIGHLIGHTS ----------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11149  == erts ==

	      A new memory allocation feature called "super carrier" has
	      been introduced. The super carrier feature can be used in
	      different ways. It can for example be used for pre-allocation
	      of all memory that the runtime system should be able to use.

	      By default the super carrier is disabled. It is enabled by
	      passing the +MMscs <size in MB> command line argument. For
	      more information see the documentation of the +MMsco,
	      +MMscrfsd, +MMscrpm, +MMscs, +MMusac, and, +Mlpm command line
	      arguments in the erts_alloc(3) documentation.

	      Since it is disabled by default there should be no impact on
	      system characteristics if not used.

	      This change has been marked as a potential incompatibility
	      since the returned list when calling
	      erlang:system_info({allocator, mseg_alloc}) now also include
	      an {erts_mmap, _} tuple as one element in the list.


--- otp -----------------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11323  Remove ^L characters hidden randomly in the code. Not those
	      used in text files as delimiters. Thanks to Pierre Fenoll.

   OTP-11448  Update INSTALL md, added info how to generate configure file
	      if building from git. Thanks to Jakub Oboza.

   OTP-11472  Fixed typo in gen_fsm example. Thanks to Boris Mühmer.


--- asn1-2.0.4 ----------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11314  The new option 'no_ok_wrapper' generates M:encode/2 and
	      M:decode/2 functions that don't wrap the return value in an
	      {ok,...} tuple.

   OTP-11319  The default value for a BIT STRING would not always be
	      recognized, causing the encoding to be incorrect for the
	      DER/PER/UPER encodings.

   OTP-11360  The asn1 application would fail to build if the .erlang file
	      printed something to standard output.

   OTP-11411  An union of integer ranges in an INTEGER constraint could
	      sometimes be interpreted as the intersection of the range.

   OTP-11415  Extensible, multiple single value constraints (such as
	      INTEGER (1|17, ...)) would be incorrectly encoded.

   OTP-11504  The ASN.1 compiler would fail to compile a constraint with
	      values given for for the extension part (such as INTEGER
	      (1..10, ..., 11..20)).


--- common_test-1.7.4 ---------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10631  Return values from group and testcase info functions are now
	      properly checked, and associated test cases are auto skipped
	      if a return value is invalid.

   OTP-11305  The way Common Test handles skipping of test cases has been
	      updated. In previous versions, returning {skip,Reason} from a
	      configuration function (such as init_per_suite or
	      init_per_group), resulted in all affected test cases getting
	      skipped with status auto_skipped. This was inappropriate,
	      since this status is supposed to be used to inform that
	      Common Test has taken the initiative to skip something (e.g.
	      a test case group if init_per_group failed). Therefore, in
	      this version of Common Test, whenever the user skips a suite,
	      group, or individual test case (by means of a configuration
	      function or test specification term), the affected test cases
	      get the status user_skipped instead.

	      This update has meant a few changes that may affect Common
	      Test users in various ways:

	      -- The test results and statistics will be affected, which is
	      important to know when running regression tests and comparing
	      results to previous test runs.

	      -- Users that read or parse the textual log file suite.log
	      will notice that an auto skipped function is now reported as
	      auto_skipped rather than skipped as before.

	      -- When require fails in an info function (such as suite/0 or
	      group/1), all affected configuration functions and test cases
	      are marked as auto_skipped.

	      -- If Common Test detects an error in the test suite (such as
	      e.g. an invalid all/0 function), all affected configuration
	      functions and test cases are marked as auto_skipped.

	      -- If a repeated test run session reaches a deadline with
	      force_stop enabled, all remaining test cases are marked as
	      auto_skipped rather than user_skipped as before.

	      -- The event messages that Common Test generates during test
	      runs have been affected by this update. For details see
	      OTP-11524.

   OTP-11401  Fix cth_log_redirect.erl to fulfill gen_event behaviour.
	      Thanks to Roberto Aloi.

   OTP-11409  Returning {skip, Reason} from a pre_end_per_group/3 user hook
	      function would result in an exit in the Common Test
	      cth_log_redirect hook. This problem has been solved.

   OTP-11478  When the netconf server did not respond to the close-session
	      request, the call to ct_netconfc:close_session/2 would hang
	      forever waiting for the netconf client to terminate. This has
	      been corrected. The client will now always terminate (and
	      take down the connection) if the close-session request times
	      out.

   OTP-11523  The first argument of the CT hook callback function
	      on_tc_skip/3 has been modified. When this function is called
	      for init_per_group or end_per_group, the value of the first
	      argument is now {init_per_group,GroupName} or
	      {end_per_group,GroupName}.

   OTP-11524  The following modifications have been made to the event
	      messages that Common Test sends during test execution:

	      -- For the tc_auto_skip event, the value of the Func element
	      has changed from end_per_group to {end_per_group,GroupName}.

	      -- When require fails in an info function, such as suite/0 or
	      group/1, the init configuration function is now reported as
	      auto_skipped intead of skipped, with the tc_done event.

	      -- When require fails in an info function because of a
	      configuration name already in use, the tc_done event now
	      reports the error with a tuple (of size 2) tagged failed
	      instead of skipped.

	      Please see the Event Handling chapter in the Common Test
	      User's Guide for reference.


--- compiler-4.9.4 ------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11267  Lift 'after' blocks to zeroary functions. Thanks to Anthony
	      Ramine.

   OTP-11455  Typo fix ambigous -> ambiguous. Thanks to Leo Correa.


--- crypto-3.2 ----------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11510  Fix uninitialized pointers in crypto (Thanks to Anthony
	      Ramine)


--- dialyzer-2.6.2 ------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11374  Fixed a dialyzer crash when using remote types in the tail
	      position of a maybe_improper_list/2 type. Thanks to Kostis
	      Sagonas


--- diameter-1.4.4 ------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11367  Fix setting of End-to-End and Hop-by-Hop Identifiers in 
              outgoing DWA. Broken by OTP-11184, which caused the identifiers 
              to be set anew, discarding the values from the incoming 
              DWR. 

   OTP-11395  Fix handling of 5014, DIAMETER_INVALID_AVP_LENGTH. The error 
              was detected as 5004, DIAMETER_INVALID_AVP_VALUE, for some 
              Diameter types, in which case an AVP length that pointed 
              past the end of a message resulted in encode failure.


--- diameter-1.5 --------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11168  Rename reconnect_timer to connect_timer.

	      The former is still accepted for backwards compatibility, but
	      the name is misleading given the semantics of the timer.

   OTP-11348  Extend diameter_make(3).

	      Dictionaries can now be compiled from strings, not just
	      filesystem paths, and results can be returned instead of
	      written to the filesystem.

   OTP-11361  Remove hardcoding of diameter_base as @prefix on dictionaries
	      for application id 0.

   OTP-11514  Fix silent make rules (Thanks to Anthony Ramine)


--- eldap-1.0.2 ---------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11336  The ldap client eldap now supports the start_tls operation.
	      This upgrades an existing tcp connection to encryption using
	      tls, if the server supports it. See eldap:start_tls/2 and /3.

   OTP-11354  Removed {verify,0} from ssl-options because eldap does not
	      support peer verification. Thanks to Florian Waas for
	      reporting.


--- erl_interface-3.7.15 ------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11517  Silence warnings (Thanks to Anthony Ramine)


--- erts-5.10.3.1 -------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11318  Memory allocators will be able to create sys_alloc carriers 
              as fallback, if mseg_alloc cannot create more carriers, 
              on systems with posix_memalign() support. This is similar 
              to how it worked in pre-R16 releases. Windows systems will 
              create carriers using _aligned_malloc() and can by this 
              use the new optimized allocator header scheme introduced 
              in R16 on other platforms.


--- erts-5.10.4 ---------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10229  New socket functions inet:socknames/1,2 and
	      inet:peernames/1,2 have been implemented. They are useful for
	      SCTP sockets since they return all addresses for an
	      association. For other sockets they fall back to
	      inet:sockname/1 and inet:peername/1, so the new functions can
	      replace the old for any application that wants to be multi
	      address aware yet socket type agnostic. See the
	      documentation.

   OTP-11149  A new memory allocation feature called "super carrier" has
	      been introduced. The super carrier feature can be used in
	      different ways. It can for example be used for pre-allocation
	      of all memory that the runtime system should be able to use.

	      By default the super carrier is disabled. It is enabled by
	      passing the +MMscs <size in MB> command line argument. For
	      more information see the documentation of the +MMsco,
	      +MMscrfsd, +MMscrpm, +MMscs, +MMusac, and, +Mlpm command line
	      arguments in the erts_alloc(3) documentation.

	      Since it is disabled by default there should be no impact on
	      system characteristics if not used.

	      This change has been marked as a potential incompatibility
	      since the returned list when calling
	      erlang:system_info({allocator, mseg_alloc}) now also include
	      an {erts_mmap, _} tuple as one element in the list.

   OTP-11170  When normalizing paths, erl_prim_loader would always convert
	      backslash to forward slash. This is correct on Windows, but
	      not on other operating systems. erl_prim_loader now checks
	      which OS is running before performing this conversion.

   OTP-11349  Fixed syslog defines and defined LOG_ERR for systems without
	      syslog.h. Thanks to Matt Lewandowsky.

   OTP-11350  Check all pattern arguments passed to binary:matches/2.
	      Thanks to Mike Sassak.

   OTP-11351  Fix two small silent rules omissions. Thanks to Anthony
	      Ramine.

   OTP-11362  Added erlang:system_info(ets_limit) to provide a way to
	      retrieve the runtime's maximum number of ETS tables. Thanks
	      to Steve Vinoski

   OTP-11371  Teach configure to detect if posix_memalign cannot align to
	      more than the system page size. 

	      For cross-compiled systems a new environment variable called
	      erl_xcomp_posix_memalign has been introduced to indicate
	      whether posix_memalign should be used.

   OTP-11381  Fix bsr bug occurring when shifting a huge number a huge
	      number of bits to the right. Thanks to Lars Hesel
	      Christensen.

   OTP-11410  Fix memory leak for distributed monitors

   OTP-11414  Fix various typos in erts, kernel and ssh. Thanks to Martin
	      HÃ¤ssler.

   OTP-11420  Crashdumps initiated by out-of-memory on process spawn could
	      cause the beam to segfault during crashdump writing due to
	      invalid pointers.

	      The pointers are invalid since the process creation never
	      finished. This fix removes these processes from the
	      printouts. Reported by Richard Carlsson.

   OTP-11446  Add new BIF os:unsetenv/1 which deletes an environment
	      variable. Thanks to Martin HÃ¤ssler.

   OTP-11450  Crash dumps from 64-bit Erlang machines would have all memory
	      addresses truncated to 32 bits, which could cause trouble
	      inspecting processes message queues and stacks in the
	      crashdump viewer.

   OTP-11456  Threads other than schedulers threads could make thread
	      unsafe accesses when support for migration of memory carriers
	      had been enabled, i.e., when the +M<S>acul command line flag
	      had been passed to erl. This could cause corruption of the
	      VMs internal state.

	      This bug was introduced in erts-5.10.2 when the support for
	      migration of memory carriers was introduced.

   OTP-11479  Fix bug in binary_to_term for invalid bitstrings and very
	      large binaries (>2Gb).

   OTP-11489  Introduced a new guarantee regarding exit signals from ports:

	      If the process calling one of the synchronous port BIFs
	      listed below is linked to the port identified by the first
	      argument, and the port exits before sending the result of the
	      port operation, the exit signal issued due to this link will
	      be received by the processes before the BIF returns, or fail
	      with an exception due to the port not being open.

	      The synchronous port BIFs are:

	      -- port_close/1

	      -- port_command/2

	      -- port_command/3

	      -- port_connect/2

	      -- port_control/3

	      -- erlang:port_call/3

	      -- erlang:port_info/1

	      -- erlang:port_info/2

	      Note that some ports under certain circumstances unlink
	      themselves from the calling process before exiting, i.e. even
	      though the process linked itself to the port there might be
	      no link triggering an exit signal.

	      Characteristics impact: The return or exception from the
	      synchronous port BIF will be delayed if the port
	      simultaneously exit due to some issue unrelated to the
	      outstanding synchronous port BIF call. In all other cases
	      characteristics are unchanged.

   OTP-11491  Under rare circumstances a process calling inet:close/1,
	      gen_tcp:close/1, gen_udp:close/1, or gen_sctp:close/1 could
	      hang in the call indefinitely.

   OTP-11496  Fix bug that could cause a 32-bit emulator to always crash at
	      start (since R16B01) depending on the alignment of static
	      data in the beam executable.

   OTP-11501  Fix benign bugs regarding bitstring compare. Only a nuisance
	      for debug and valgrind VM.

   OTP-11517  Silence warnings (Thanks to Anthony Ramine)

   OTP-11521  The default wordsize of the emulator (beam) is now determined
	      by compiler default on Mac OSX (Darwin). This was previously
	      forced to 32bits by the configure script unless otherwise
	      specified.


--- eunit-2.2.6 ---------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11373  Fix I/O-protocol error handling in eunit. Thanks to Yuki Ito.

   OTP-11467  Do not attempt to detect lists of printable characters in
	      format. Thanks to Roberto Aloi.

   OTP-11516  Fix silent make rule (Thanks to Anthony Ramine )


--- hipe-3.10.2.2 -------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11374  Fixed a dialyzer crash when using remote types in the tail
	      position of a maybe_improper_list/2 type. Thanks to Kostis
	      Sagonas


--- ic-4.3.4 ------------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11351  Fix two small silent rules omissions. Thanks to Anthony
	      Ramine.

   OTP-11517  Silence warnings (Thanks to Anthony Ramine)


--- inets-5.9.7 ---------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11037  The ftp client now supports ftp over tls (ftps).

   OTP-11276  Fix httpd config option 'script_timeout' and fixed httpd
	      config option 'keep_alive_timeout'. Thanks to Johannes
	      Weissl.

   OTP-11312  Make httpc:request_cancel/[1,2] asynchronous. Previously
	      these functions tried to guarantee request answer would not
	      reach the client, which only worked for some of the use
	      cases. Now these functions are totally asynchronous which
	      makes it the clients responsibility to disregard possible
	      answers to canceled requests. 

	      Also pipelining implementation has been changed to improve
	      the utilization factor. Further investigation of possible
	      enhancements in this area are planned for later.

   OTP-11328  [httpd] Add handling of new response for mod_head (otherwise
	      causing case_clause crash). Also updated logging: Removed
	      logging for keep-alive connections timeout (this is a normal
	      occurrence and not an error) and some access-log body size
	      corrections.


--- kernel-2.16.4 -------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10229  New socket functions inet:socknames/1,2 and
	      inet:peernames/1,2 have been implemented. They are useful for
	      SCTP sockets since they return all addresses for an
	      association. For other sockets they fall back to
	      inet:sockname/1 and inet:peername/1, so the new functions can
	      replace the old for any application that wants to be multi
	      address aware yet socket type agnostic. See the
	      documentation.

   OTP-11377  Fix the typespec for the inet:ifget/2 and inet:ifget/3 return
	      value. Thanks to Ali Sabil.

   OTP-11379  Add more SCTP errors as described in RFC 4960. Thanks to
	      Artem Teslenko.

   OTP-11414  Fix various typos in erts, kernel and ssh. Thanks to Martin
	      HÃ¤ssler.

   OTP-11446  Add new BIF os:unsetenv/1 which deletes an environment
	      variable. Thanks to Martin HÃ¤ssler.

   OTP-11471  Fix rpc multicall sample code. Thanks to Edwin Fine.

   OTP-11491  Under rare circumstances a process calling inet:close/1,
	      gen_tcp:close/1, gen_udp:close/1, or gen_sctp:close/1 could
	      hang in the call indefinitely.


--- mnesia-4.11 ---------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11375  Fixed a race in mnesia which could cause hanging transaction
	      when sticky locks had been used. Thanks janchochol.

   OTP-11485  Fixed dirty_update_counter which could return ok, thanks
	      Anton Ryabkov.


--- observer-1.3.1.2 ----------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11335  The documentation for ttb:tracer/2 incorrectly stated that
	      there was an option named 'overload', while the correct name
	      used in the implementation is 'overload_check'.

   OTP-11475  Fixed typo in observer documentation. Thanks to Dave Parfitt.


--- odbc-2.10.18 --------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11483  Configure now also checks for the existence of the sql.h
	      header file


--- os_mon-2.2.14 -------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11454  Fix incorrect reporting of memory on OS X via memsup. Thanks
	      to Christopher Meiklejohn.


--- public_key-0.21 -----------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11380  Fixed a little typo in public_key documentation. Thanks to
	      Tomas Morstein.

   OTP-11470  public_key: Workaround for incorrectly encoded utf8
	      emailAddress. Thanks to Andrew Bennett.


--- runtime_tools-1.8.13 ------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11520  Observer did not produce correct result when ERTS internal
	      memory allocators had been disabled.


--- sasl-2.3.4 ----------------------------------------------------------

    OTP-8479  Added a boot file which skips loading the "$HOME/.erlang"
	      file on startup. Enable by starting erlang with "erl -boot
	      no_dot_erlang".

   OTP-11464  Don't try to add the log_mf_h handler in sasl unless
	      configured to do so. Thanks to Richard Carlsson.

   OTP-11507  Fix confusing documentation about error handlers in
	      SASL.(Thanks to Richard Carlsson)

   OTP-11529  A bug in the mechanism for upgrading core parts of Erlang/OTP
	      (emulator, kernel, stdlib, sasl) caused a switch of paths
	      between stdlib and sasl in the intermediate .script/.boot
	      file. The bug was introduces along with this upgrade
	      mechanism in R15B. It has now been corrected. (Thanks to
	      Tobias Schlager)


--- snmp-4.25 -----------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11307  [manager] Improved handling of unexpected/invalid return
	      values and crashes from called snmpm_user callback functions.

   OTP-11352  Enable SNMP to create missing database directories. Add
	      {db_init_error, create_db_and_dir} option to SNMP manager and
	      agent. This allows them to create any missing parent
	      directories for db_dir, rather than treating any missing
	      directories as a fatal error. The default for db_init_error,
	      which is terminate, is unchanged.

   OTP-11412  [manager] Wrong block cypher type used for AES ('aes_cbf128'
	      instead of 'aes_cfb128') when performing AES block
	      encrypt/decrypt.

   OTP-11413  [manager] When performing the AES encryption, invalid values
	      for the EngineBoots and EngineTime was used. The values of
	      the local agent was used, which would have produced some
	      values if an agent was actually running. If not it would have
	      caused a crash.


--- ssh-3.0 -------------------------------------------------------------

   OTP-10976  Add option to disallow CLI

   OTP-11296  Add sockname and user to ssh:connection_info/2

   OTP-11339  The ssh cli is now faster at close and before new prompt.

   OTP-11363  Ssh process structure was redesigned to better map to what is
	      truly parallel this has solved a lot of strange timing issues
	      that sometimes would occur, for instance a process leak could
	      happen when a lot of connections where taken up and down in
	      parallel in a short period of time. Also backwards compatible
	      clauses to "original" but never supported features has been

--- test_server-3.6.4 ---------------------------------------------------

   OTP-11305  The way Common Test handles skipping of test cases has been
	      updated. In previous versions, returning {skip,Reason} from a
	      configuration function (such as init_per_suite or
	      init_per_group), resulted in all affected test cases getting
	      skipped with status auto_skipped. This was inappropriate,
	      since this status is supposed to be used to inform that
	      Common Test has taken the initiative to skip something (e.g.
	      a test case group if init_per_group failed). Therefore, in
	      this version of Common Test, whenever the user skips a suite,
	      group, or individual test case (by means of a configuration
	      function or test specification term), the affected test cases
	      get the status user_skipped instead.

	      This update has meant a few changes that may affect Common
	      Test users in various ways:

	      -- The test results and statistics will be affected, which is
	      important to know when running regression tests and comparing
	      results to previous test runs.

	      -- Users that read or parse the textual log file suite.log
	      will notice that an auto skipped function is now reported as
	      auto_skipped rather than skipped as before.

	      -- When require fails in an info function (such as suite/0 or
	      group/1), all affected configuration functions and test cases
	      are marked as auto_skipped.

	      -- If Common Test detects an error in the test suite (such as
	      e.g. an invalid all/0 function), all affected configuration
	      functions and test cases are marked as auto_skipped.

	      -- If a repeated test run session reaches a deadline with
	      force_stop enabled, all remaining test cases are marked as
	      auto_skipped rather than user_skipped as before.

	      -- The event messages that Common Test generates during test
	      runs have been affected by this update. For details see
	      OTP-11524.
